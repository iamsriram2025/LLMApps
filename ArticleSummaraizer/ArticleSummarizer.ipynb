There are a lot of viable options, from well-known public platforms like Medium to specialized tools like Jekyll. You could even get your engineering team to build your own in-house platform on a headless CMS.\\nThis question comes up a lot in\\ncalls with clients\\n, so I wanted to round up some of the best writing platforms for running your technical blog, and share a little bit about why you might choose each of them. Note that we’ve also written detailed tutorials and comparisons for many of these, so be sure to check out the articles linked in each section.\\nMedium\\nOne of the most popular blog platforms for developers out there is\\nMedium\\n. People often choose it because of the built-in distribution that receives millions of unique monthly visitors. The more eyeballs on your online blog platform, the better, right? Medium’s audience tends to skew towards articles relating to technology, startups, and all business topics, so that makes it very compelling for software engineering blogs.\\nAnother positive that Medium presents is its Domain Authority (DA).\\nDA gives us a statistical measure\\nof how well your site will rank in search engines. Medium’s high DA means that you’ll be getting a lot of traffic organically because articles on Medium will likely be indexed and ranked faster than those on a brand new website. Finally, Medium allows\\xa0 readers to add\\xa0 comments and “claps” – basically “likes” – to each post, showing how popular each piece is.\\nThe big drawback to Medium (and similar platforms like\\nDev.to\\nor\\nHashnode\\n) is that you don’t have full control over the ads and articles surrounding your content. You also don’t build domain authority on your site, so publishing on Medium alone won’t help your primary domain rank higher in Google.\\nFor that reason, I recommend\\nsyndicating your content to Medium\\n, but not publishing there exclusively.\\nGatsby\\nGatsby\\nis an open source platform that generates blazing fast static sites and includes lots of features for search engine optimization and publication. Gatsby is purpose-built for developers and is based on React.js, making it familiar to many frontend developers.\\nA static site generator (SSG) like Gatsby is a great option for more technical users because the performance is fantastic and there’s no server vulnerabilities to worry about. Gatsby sites don’t have to deal with server requests because everything is pre-rendered when application is built and deployed.\\nGatsby uses GraphQL to manage data through its vibrant plugin ecosystem. If you use something like\\nNetlify\\nin conjunction with Gatsby, you can easily manage your content with the use of these plugins. Or, you can use their gatsby-image and gatsby-plugin-favicon to easily process and size your images.\\nOne of the biggest issues with Gatsby is searching large content libraries.
